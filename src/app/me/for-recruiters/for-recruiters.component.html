            - Full stack Development of Web Apps and Native Apps(Mobile and Desktop Apps)<br />
            - Research and Development of Web3.0 and DAO related field<br /><br />

            Below are the things I want to do but I have little or no experience of.<br>

            - What I Care in Communication and Business<br>
              -- integrity, humor, transparency, long-term perspective, seriousness, balance, kindness, enthusiasm, higher problem-solving awareness, nuance<br>
            - What I Care in Communication in Recruitment Flow<br>
              -- Because of above such as integrity, transparency and the like, I communicate as always (at least I try).<br>
              Plus, I think it's a shame that just for the recruiting background the communication in interview and the possible relationships will be in vain.<br>
              We can be more open and flexible.
