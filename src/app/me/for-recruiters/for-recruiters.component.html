            - What I Care in Communication and Business<br>
              -- integrity, humor, transparency, long-term perspective, seriousness, balance, kindness, enthusiasm, higher problem-solving awareness<br>
            - What I Care in Interview Communication<br>
              -- Because of above such as integrity, transparency and the like, I communicate as always (at least I try).<br>
              Plus, I think it's a shame that just for the recruiting background the communication in interview and the possible relationships will be in vain.<br>
              We can be more open and flexible.
